                    <p>The site is currently working for 2020.</p>
                    <p>Simply enter the codes for your units of study in a comma delimitated list and hit submit.</p>

                    <h4>How does it work?</h4>
                    <p>
                        The program currently tries to present to you the timetables that it finds to best fit the given citeria.
                        This criteria has been tailored to produce timetables that have as many classes as possible on a single day
                        and leaving as many free days as possible. In this process it prioritises scheduling non lectures, as lectures 
                        can be placed on off days and be skipped for online viewing. 
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="col border border-top-0 border-bottom-0 border-right-0">
                    <h4>Can i change the criteria?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Being able to change the criteria so that the program could produce a timetable that is perfect for you is the ultimate
                        goal and is in the works. Hopefully it will be available soon! If you have any other feature requests let me know and 
                        ill see if i can add it in.
